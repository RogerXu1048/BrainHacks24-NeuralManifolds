# Project Description
What are the meaningful changes in the brain with experience, that allows for adaptive behavior? When we look at the coordinated activity across spiking networks of neuronal ensembles, we see a delicate balance of stability and flexibility, as needed for a system that can both learn and remember. In this project, we present a population of simultaneously-recorded neurons from the non-human primate during learning of a complex sequence memory task, and in sleep afterwards. These data are exceptionally rich for exploration, but also to address three fundamental questions: 1. can we decode behavioral states from teh ensemble dynamics, 2. what is the core representational geometry of the ensembles (what factors are best preserved/differentiated in low-dimensional spaces, and how does the geometry constrain the computations and dynamics of the network, and finally, 3. Does the ensemble activity drift with time and experience, and if so, how?

Here's a cool illustration of [neural ensembles in macaque hippocampus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLZRPLcwW4) which we are interested in studying. 

# Open Research Themes 
1. Experiment on neural manifold creation with using different hyperparameters
2. Create UI to visualize neural manifolds across different hyperparameters
3. Parallelize dimensionality reduction across a set of hyperparameters
4. Experiment with which behavioral parameters are most separated in low dimensional space (block type, trial number, time, head position, angular velocity, etc.)
5. [Structural Index](https://github.com/PridaLab/structure_index) for Neural Manifolds
